            <h1>JOKER</h1><h3>(2019)</h3>
            Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur 
            Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of 
            Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he 
            paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he 
            projects in a futile attempt to feel like he's part of 
            the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded
            by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness 
            as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as 
            the Joker.

            <h1>ALIENS</h1><h3>(1986)</h3>
            After floating in space for 57 years, Lt. Ripley's 
            (Sigourney Weaver) shuttle is found by a deep space 
            salvage team. Upon arriving at LV-426, the marines 
            find only one survivor, a nine year old girl named 
            Newt (Carrie Henn). But even these battle-hardened 
            marines with all the latest weaponry are no match 
            for the hundreds of aliens that have invaded the colony.
